# Android Policy Compliance Guide

## Overview
ScreenWise has been designed with full Android policy compliance in mind, implementing best practices for user privacy, data protection, and transparent permission handling.

## Privacy & Data Protection

### 1. Transparent Data Collection
- **Clear explanation**: Users are informed about what data is collected and why
- **Permission context**: Permissions are requested with clear explanations before prompting
- **Opt-out available**: Users can decline permissions and use limited functionality

### 2. Data Usage Transparency
- **Privacy Policy Dialog**: Accessible from app settings
- **Data categories clearly listed**: App usage, device info, preferences, AI interactions
- **Third-party sharing policy**: Clear statement that no data is sold or shared
- **Retention policy**: Defined data retention and deletion timelines

### 3. User Control & Rights
- **Data export**: Complete data export in portable JSON format
- **Data deletion**: One-click deletion of all user data
- **Permission revocation**: Clear instructions for revoking permissions in Android Settings
- **Account deletion**: Permanent account and data removal

## Permission Handling

### 1. Context-Aware Requests
- **Explanation first**: Permission explanation dialog shown before system prompt
- **Progressive disclosure**: Permissions requested only when needed for functionality
- **Graceful degradation**: App functions with limited features when permissions denied

### 2. Required Permissions
- **PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS**: For app usage tracking (with clear explanation)
- **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES**: To identify installed apps for categorization
- **INTERNET**: For AI features and cloud sync (clearly marked as optional)

### 3. Permission Best Practices
- **No automatic requests**: Permissions only requested with user intent
- **Clear benefits**: Users understand the value of granting permissions
- **Alternative modes**: Limited functionality available without sensitive permissions

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Encryption
- **In transit**: All data encrypted using HTTPS/TLS
- **At rest**: Database encryption using Supabase security standards
- **Local processing**: Usage stats processed locally when possible

### 2. Authentication
- **Secure auth flow**: Using Supabase Auth with industry standards
- **Session management**: Proper session handling and timeout
- **Account recovery**: Secure password reset flows

### 3. Data Minimization
- **Need-to-know basis**: Only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Anonymization**: AI interactions are anonymized when possible
- **Local-first**: Prefer local processing over cloud when feasible

## Compliance Features

### 1. GDPR/CCPA Ready
- **Right to know**: Clear privacy policy and data usage disclosure
- **Right to access**: Full data export functionality

- **Parental controls**: Support for parental oversight features
- **Educational content**: Focus on digital wellness education

### 3. Accessibility
